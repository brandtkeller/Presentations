- With Automation

# Introduction
- The Why
- The How
- Reusable Components
- Meaningful Automation
- Iterate and Adapt

---

# The Why
- The WHY 
    - Iteratively improve 
    - Build trust
    - Rinse and Repeat
- Reduce Manual Processes where Applicable
- Attempt to combat the intersection of data overload with outdated approval processes 

<!--
- We have to take into account the domains for which cATO does not account for - things like hardware or overall system compliance
- Combatting Compliance Theater - 
-->

---

# The How
- Reusable Components
    - Infrastructure
    - Platform
    - Application
- Meaningful Automation
- Iterate and Adapt

<!--
- We want to look towards what sustainability means 
-->

---

# Re-usable Components
- Common - maintained - secure baselines/architectures
    - Big Bang
- Declarative software packages
    - SBOM included by default
- Establish reusable and machine-readable compliance artifacts
    - NIST OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language)
    - Body of Evidence generation for ATO
    - Delivered from source of truth


<!--
- Where possible, we want to collaborate on secure baselines
- We want to capture and test assumptions around the software packages we produce
    - Connectivity
    - Dependencies

-->

---

# Meaningful Automation
- What do we do today towards ATO / Security Posture
    - Data collection
    - Data analysis
    - Findings
- How can we automate parts of this process?
    - Where does it make sense to do it?
    - Who owns the responsibility?
<!--
- 
-->

---

# Validation
- Pre-flight checks
    - Dependency & Vulnerability Management
    - Compliance validation 
- Runtime Validation
    - How has global context of the environment changed assumptions?

---

# Iterate and Adapt
- Identify gaps in the current implementation
- Adapt to standards that provide common formats/structures
- Generation of reporting that enhances software/hardware deliverable
